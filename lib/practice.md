## Practice: Install a Package for Enumeration

- What package did you install for enumeration?

```md
lodash
```

## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1:
```md
async
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
asynchronous control flow
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
```md
`npm install --save async`

require async in the file where I want to use it

cry myself to sleep because I hate this library so much
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
```md
seems pretty well maintained, based on frequency of commits and number of active and closed issues/pull requests.
```

Package 2:
```md
underscore
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
I honestly do not know what problem this solves. Probably JavaScript devs not having enough random dependencies.
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
```md
I guess I would use it to help with functional programming problems that I don't know I have yet?

update: I talked to a friend of mine who is doing a PhD in computer science and she said that underscore turns JavaScript into a much more useable functional language.

This actually leads me to a question: Is it fair to say that naked JavaScript is stuck halfway between being a functional language and an object oriented one?

`npm install --save underscore`

require the file where you need it.
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?

seems pretty well maintained, based on frequency of commits and number of active and closed issues/pull requests.
```

Package 3:
```md
request
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
apparently making http requests is too difficult or something
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?2.
```md
`npm install --save request`

require it where needed

Is this just ajax but for the back end?
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?2.
```md
It seems fairly well maintained. The last commit on master was a week ago and it has 422 open issues, which leads me to believe they are in the middle of implementing stuff.
```
