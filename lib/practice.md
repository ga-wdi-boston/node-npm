Enum

## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1: Express

1.  What problem does this package solve?
Allows devs to use JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Works with Node.js to build an entire site with JavaScript: develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express.

Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
Express can be installed and then required in files just like any other node module. Then create a request handler that talks to the server and goes through all the middleware using the Express routing system until the end. This makes it easier to make robust full-stack apps using JS and Node.js.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
It's extremely robust; many people use it judging by the amount/quality of documentation and stackOverflow questions.

Package 2: Async

1.  What problem does this package solve?
Async allows you to increase performance by getting rid of render-blocking JavaScript that resides in the “above the fold” parts of a page that does not load until JavaScript itself has been finished loading in the page. Async.js loads JavaScript content alongside everything else, and makes it even faster.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
Npm install then use event loops and promises to build out logic functions that would otherwise devolve into callback hell. The code then allows for actions that haven't happened yet but will happen in the future, helping you to structure your applications and making control flow easier.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
Quite well-maintained; decent documentation and use cases seen online.

Package 3: Request

1.  What problem does this package solve?
Request is the most reliable HTTP Client library. It helps apps make external HTTP calls, whether to fetch data or to load data directly from an external source in an easy, secure, and reliable way.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
Npm install, then use shorthand methods, custom configurations, and strams to access various APIs.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
Well maintained; forked and starred many times on Github, several online resources.
