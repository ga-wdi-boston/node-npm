## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1: ```Express```

1.  What problem does this package solve? ```It provides a high performance web framework for node.```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved? ```This is one of the packages we've used in class.  By requiring express in the server.js file it looks like we were then able to setup routes, middleware, error handlers, etc.```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide? ```It's very well maintained. I looked at the "most starred" packages on NPM and then looked at github to see the number/frequency of commits.```

Package 2: ```gulp```

1.  What problem does this package solve? ```It looks like Gulp is a build tool similar to Grunt.  From what I've been able to find online, it's recommended more for groups that are well-versed in Node because it makes use of Node streams to read/pipe data before finally being output to disk.```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved? ```After requiring gulp, you're good to go.  You can start using gulp.task to build out your tasks lists and use .pipe along with any other packages you want to transform your data.```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?  ```It's also very well-maintained.  As with the last package, I looked at the "most starred" packages on NPM and then looked at github to see the number/frequency of commits.```

Package 3: ```async```

1.  What problem does this package solve? ```It provides a bunch of functions and patterns for async control flow within JavaScript.```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved? ```You can use npm intall or bower/component/jam to install the package.  Then you can use functions by calling them with dot notation (ex. async.map). Each function requires a callback.```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide? ```I followed the same process as with the first two: I looked at the "most starred" packages on NPM and then looked at github to see the number/frequency of commits.```
