## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1:

1.  What problem does this package solve?
 request: Facilitates HTTP requests.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
  One simply "requires" it. It seems that this can be used in lieu of (or in addition to?)
  ajax calls. I'm not clear on that. The answer would probably present itself if
  I ever ran into a situation where it became clear that something like this
  would help. It's not always clear to me how useful something like this would be
  until I end up needing it.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
  There seem to be regular updates, and the idea of an alternate way of making
  HTTP requests seemed interesting.

Package 2:

1.  What problem does this package solve?
  browserify: This simplifies "require" in your app. That is, instead of writing "require"
  code for all npm packages, browserify puts them in a single script file.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
  I can use it in lieu of repeatedly writing "require" statements.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
  It's updated pretty regularly.

Package 3:

1.  What problem does this package solve?
  passport: appears to be an alternative mode of authentication. Also looks
  like it facilitates persisting data locally.
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
  I can use it when I want to write authentication code.
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
  It appears to be maintained regularly.
