## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1:

Grunt
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
Grunt is a task runner that relieves developers from the time it takes to test code, compile tasks, compile lint, etc by doing that for you.
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
```md
While you have to install Grunt and write your own tests, once written, many of the routine, 'mundane' tasks developers put themselves through can be taken care of via grunt.
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
```md
While grunt comes with many of its own plug-ins, it also allows the user to create his/her own, so maintenance, if you have the skills, is easy.
```

Gulp
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?

```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
```md
Gulp is a newer package, so it is fairly up to date and has seemingly been well maintained given it already has several versions with listings of the bugs each new version fixes.
```

Package 3:

Passport

After installation, passport should help the user with his/her authentication requests based on whether or not they fail or succeed.
