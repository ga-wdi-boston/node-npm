## Practice: Install a Package for Enumeration

- What package did you install for enumeration?

```md
I installed browserify. You write code that uses 'require' for the browser as you
would use it in node.js
```

## Research: Popular NPM Packages

Package 1:
```md
grunt-cli
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
We already use this one pretty frequently, and it loads and runs the version of grunt
installed locally. grunt is a task runner, so basically grunt-cli tells grunt to do things.
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
```md
grunt-cli can not work without grunt and we most frequently use grunt to deploy the front end to the local host and to run tests.
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
```md
I don't know if this is the best response, but if there is a large user base, I think the package must be safe and well maintained. grunt-cli had over 1.5 million downloads last month alone and I know how useful it is from personal experience now.
```

Package 2:
```md
bower
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
It manages other front-end package libraries for javascript and css.
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
```md
My understanding of bower is that you don't use it in your actual code, you use it to manage other libraries/
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
```md
It still seems fairly popular, but I have read a nuber of opinions on reddit now that say it is since npm is being used more frequently for front end packages, Bower is not as important as it used to be.
```

Package 3:
```md
gulp
```
1.  What problem does this package solve?
```md
gulp is used to automate time-consuming tasks in the development workflow.
```
1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?2.
```md
It requires a minimal API surface and then it will have access to many plugins that should make the workflow easier.
```
1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?2.
```md
Again, it is quite popular with almost 3 million downloads last month.
```
