Package 1:  Hapi.js

1.  What problem does this package solve?
It allows you to specify a port when initializing a server, which...from what I read can be a good thing.

1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
It is fairly similar to all other packages.  Install and go.

1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
It looks fairly well maintained.  Git hub contributers are in the 3000+ range, frequent commits.  Lots of discussion.

Package 2: Express js

1.  What problem does this package solve?
It is very powerful, with a lot of options.  It can be used for a lot of different things(not very limiting
) and has frameworks in place that you can use.

1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
Same as above.  Install and use it.

1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
Extremely well maintained.  17k+ contributers.  Constantly updated.  TONS of discussion.  People seem to like it a lot.

Package 3: Socket.io

1.  What problem does this package solve?
Quote: The framework allows real-time concurrency for document collaboration and data exchange.

That seems to set it apart.  It is known for being both back and front end interfacing, and allowing data to be instantaneous(or almost).  And it has A LOT of features.

1.  How can I use this package in my own code? What steps are involved?
Maybe I'm missing the question here, but install.  Use.

1.  How well-maintained is this package? What criteria did I use to decide?
Well maintained.  Well liked.  A lot of frameworks are actually based on this design.  Lots of updates and diehard fans.  Also, this one seemed to have a lot more references than others I looked at.  Easy to get help.
